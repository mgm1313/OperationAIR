title: FAQ
questions:
  - question: What is OperationAIR?
    answer: OperationAIR (Assist In Respiration) is an initiative from the Technical
      University of Delft. The team, consisting of 50 masterstudents under
      supervision of prof. dr. ir. Jaap Harlaar (director of studies Technical
      Medicine), has developed an emergency ventilator for covid-19 patients,
      named "AIRone", for when a potential shortage of ventilators occurs.
  - question: Why did we initiate OperationAIR?
    answer: >-
      Due to the fast spreading of COVID-19 the number of patients that are
      hospitalized in Intensive Care, has increased. In the worst-case scenario
      a shortage of ventilators arises in the Netherlands due to this increase.
      In such a situation the difficult consideration has to be made who is to
      receive intensive care. By developing this ventilator we hope to be able
      to provide intensive care for those affected by the shortage.


      The team also wants to help other countries to tackle the shortage of ventilators. Therefore, we have shared our design and documentation open source to enable other countries to make use of our knowledge. In addition, we offer support to other initiatives worldwide.
  - question: What does OperationAIR do?
    answer: We have developed an emergency ventilator for covid-19 patients that can
      be used when a shortage of regular ventilators occurs. We are producing 80
      devices for the Netherlands. In addition, we have shared our design and
      documentation open source enabling other countries to make use of our
      knowledge. We offer active support to foreign countries and initiatives.
      By sharing our design, answering questions about the development,
      production or implementation and offering support, we hope to help other
      countries to tackle the shortage of ventilators for covid-19 patients.
  - question: Does OperationAIR also manufactures ventilators for foreign countries?
    answer: No, we don't manufacture our ventilator for foreign countries. However,
      our design and documentation is open source available for use in other
      countries via this [website](https://osf.io/mn7xq/). In addition, we offer
      support to other initiatives worldwide.
  - question: I want to help, how can I contribute?
    answer: We are flattered by the amount of support offers. To maintain an
      overview of the offered help and suggestions, we would like to ask you to
      fill out the form via the link below. We then may contact you or you
      organisation for help! For international inquiries please contact

  - question: How do you act on national guidelines and advice regarding infection
      prevention, social distancing and working from home?
    answer: Our team operates conform the national guidelines against the spread of
      COVID-19. Many of our team members work from home. Some team members need
      to come to the faculty in person, to build and design the prototype. Those
      members work in small groups, spread across the faculty and keep a
      distance of 1.5 meter at all times. OperationAIR set up an infection
      protocol, which states that members with light symptoms of COVID-19 should
      stay at home and work from there. It also states that upon arrival at
      one’s workstation and multiple times per day, his/her laptop must be
      cleaned using alcohol wipes. The same is true for washing hands for at
      least 20 seconds with soap. Furthermore, team members keep each other up
      to date via online meetings on platforms as Skype and Zoom
